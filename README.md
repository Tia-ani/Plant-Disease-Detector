# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Problem Statement
Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for improving crop yield and preventing large-scale agricultural losses. Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone, so this project explores an automated image-based solution.

## Dataset
- **PlantVillage Dataset**
- ~54,000 images
- 38 classes (healthy + diseased)
- Color leaf images

Dataset is not included in the repository due to size constraints.

## Approach
- Data exploration and visualization
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- CNN-based multi-class classification
- Training and validation split (80/20)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Status
-  Data exploration completed
- Baseline CNN model trained
- Model optimization using transfer learning
- Deployment (Streamlit)
